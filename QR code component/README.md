## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I Learned

During this challenge, I improved my understanding of flexbox and responsive design principles. Here are some key takeaways:

```html
<div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" class="rounded-lg">
</div>
```

### What I Learned

I also learned how to fine-tune typography and spacing using Tailwind CSS utilities.

## Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore more complex layouts using CSS Grid.
- Improve accessibility practices.
- Work on animations and micro-interactions.
